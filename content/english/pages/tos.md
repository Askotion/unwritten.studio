ü§ñ "Smart Bot, Not a Fortune Teller"
Our Chatbots are designed to enhance your interaction experience, not to replace official materials. While the bot strives to provide accurate information, the sole responsibility for meeting e.g. course requirements (registrations, deadlines, formatting guidelines, etc.) remains with you as a user. Any information must be verified through authorized channels (course instructors, official website, academic regulations). Decisions made based on bot recommendations cannot be used as e.g. justification for exceptions to course rules.

üéì "Good Grades Through Hard Work, Not AI Shortcuts"
The bot serves as a learning support and companion in your educational journey. However, information and explanations provided by the bot may contain errors or inaccuracies or may not align with e.g. current examiner requirements. Potential grading of your work is based exclusively on the criteria defined in e.g. the course structure and is conducted by qualified examiners. Statements or recommendations from the bot cannot be used as a basis for e.g. grade appeals or assessment challenges. The responsibility for the learning process and achievement of learning objectives lies solely with the user.

üõ°Ô∏è "Your Common Sense Is Your Best Shield"
Although our bots are developed with the best intentions, Large Language Models (LLMs) can occasionally make inappropriate, misleading, or potentially harmful suggestions. You are obligated to critically evaluate all recommendations from the bot and exercise your own sound judgment. Never follow instructions that could endanger your safety, health, well-being, or that of others, or that violate laws, university policies, or ethical principles. The partners, e.g. universities and the developers of the bot assume no liability for damages of any kind resulting from following bot recommendations.

üîí "Your Data - Your Learning Journal, Not Our Diary"
During the use of our bot, conversation data is collected for system improvement, error analysis, and research purposes. This data may be anonymized for scientific publications. Your personal data will be handled e.g. in accordance with the university's privacy policies. The use of the bot is voluntary and is e.g. not a prerequisite for successful completion of the course. You may discontinue use at any time without negative impact on e.g. your course evaluation.

‚úÖ "Consent - Quick and Painless"
By using our bot, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms of Use. You confirm that you are at least 18 years old and e.g. enrolled at the university. We and our partners, e.g. universities reserves the right to change these terms at any time, with notice provided for substantial changes.
